The system is intended mainly for fund management in families or small groups.\n- Developed a program using the Web3.js library to communicate with nodes on the Ropsten testnet. Enabled real-time communication through websockets for retrieving blockchain data and sending transactions.\n- Implemented a program using Merkle tree data structures to efficiently and securely conduct airdrops. Improved the efficiency and security of distributing specific tokens to numerous users simultaneously.\nProject 2: Design and Manufacturing of 3D Parts\nDescription: As a member of the Aeromodelling Club at IIT Delhi, designed various 3D parts for RC planes using AutoCAD and manufactured them with a 3D printer. Also had the opportunity to operate CNC machines.\nProject 3: Development and Implementation of an Obstacle Avoidance System (IoT)\nDescription: Implemented an obstacle avoidance system using Mavlink and YOLO to enhance drone safety. Developed the system for the drone using Raspberry Pi and depth cameras. Connected with Pixhawk (flight controller) via Mavlink and conducted object detection using YOLO. This system allowed the drone to automatically detect and avoid obstacles, improving flight safety and reliability."
